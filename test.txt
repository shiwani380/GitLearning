Hi 

Arctic ice is melting. This means that the polar bears cannot hunt. They are hungry. They move south to look for food.

Many of them go to a Russian village. They look for food there. They look for it in rubbish dumps. They enter houses and buildings, too.

Polar bears are big and strong. They can be dangerous.
